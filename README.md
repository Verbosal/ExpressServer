# ExpressServer

Running:
```
node index.js
```
On index.js in projekt02/express-flashcards/index.js runs a local server hosted at localhost:8000 (Same as 127.0.0.1:8000).<br><br>
You can then explore to find /cards/categories.<br><br>
The server handles inappriopriate GET requests and returns a 404 page.<br><br>
The contents are in Polish.<br><br>
